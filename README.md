# Dune Design — React (Vite) portfolio

This project is a minimal React + Vite site for Dune Design, pre-populated with the images you provided.

## How to run locally

1. Ensure you have Node.js (v16+) installed.
2. In the project folder run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

## How to deploy

I recommend Vercel:
- Create a Vercel account (or Netlify).
- Import this project repository (or drag & drop the project folder).
- Vercel will detect `vite` and deploy automatically.
- Connect your domain (e.g. dunedesign.com) in Vercel dashboard.

## Where images are
Images are in `public/assets/`. Replace them with your own files (same names) to update the site.
